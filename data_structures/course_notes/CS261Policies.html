              recitations are designed to complement one another, and
              both will provide opportunities for getting bonus points
              toward the final grade. If you miss a lecture or

              <ul>
                <li>The programming assignments will require turning in

                  by GTA's on a server that runs Unix. Make sure that
                  your homework submission compiles and runs well by
                  testing it on the School's server.<br>

                  homework submitted in this way. There will be no
                  credit for homework on your personal computers, USB
                  drives, or sent by e-mail, even when you can prove
                  that they have been done before the deadline. </li>

                <li>Late homework will be accepted without penalty only
                  in the case of emergency or with a prior approval by
                  the instructor. A request for the approval must be
                  emailed to the instructor at least <span
                    style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">two

                  penalized by <b><font color="#ff0000">20%</font></b>

                  homework submission that is late more than 24 hours
                  and less then 48 hours after the deadline will get
                  only 60% of the maximum number of points). </li>
                <br>
                <li>From experience, students often accidentally submit
                  wrong files as homework, and do not discover this
                  mistake before the deadline. Make sure this mistake
                  does not happen to you.&nbsp; </li>
                <br>
                <li>If you are having trouble with an assignment, you
                  are encouraged to discuss it with other students,
                  GTAs, the instructor, or anyone else who may help.
                  Having said that, note that homework is not a group
                  effort, but an individual work of each student.&nbsp;
                  Violation of this rule will be considered a form of
                  cheating. It is common that GTAs discover virtually
                  identical homework shared by a number of students,
                  since the students "worked on it together." This will
                  not be tolerated. </li>

              <b>Academic Honesty</b><br>
              Honesty is absolutely essential in order for learning to
              take place.&nbsp; It will form the foundation of your
              professional integrity in your career.&nbsp; In homework
              and programming assignments, it is often difficult for a
              grader to distinguish between legitimate help and
              plagiarism.&nbsp; Therefore, you might be able to get a
              good score without really understanding what you have
              handed in. <br>
              <br>
              Each student is expected to practice honorable behavior
              inside and outside the classroom. Details about academic
              dishonesty and subsequent disciplinary actions can be
              found at the official website of <a
                href="http://oregonstate.edu/admin/stucon/achon.htm">Student
















                Conduct &amp; Community Standards</a> at the Oregon
              State University. <br>
              <br>
              Examples of cheating include (but are not limited to):<br>
              - Bringing forbidden material or devices to an examination<br>
              - Working on an exam before or after the official time
              allowed<br>
              - Requesting a re-grade of answers or work that has been
              altered after the initial grading<br>
              - Submitting a homework that is not your own work<br>
              - Using code from the Internet (unless explicitly allowed
              by the instructor)<br>
              - Giving your code to other students<br>
              <br>
              At the professor's discretion, cheating on an assignment,
              or examination will result in a failing grade for the
              entire course, or a reduced grade, or a zero score for the
              particular assignment, or exam. All occurrences of
              academic dishonesty will be reported to the department
              head. If there is any question as to whether a certain
              action might be construed as cheating, please contact the
              professor before you engage in any such action.<br>

              Accommodations for students with disabilities are

              (DAS). If you, as a student, believe you are eligible for

              contact DAS immediately at 541-737-4098 or at
              http://ds.oregonstate.edu. DAS notifies students and
              faculty members of approved academic accommodations and
              coordinates implementation of those accommodations. While
              not required, students and faculty members are encouraged
              to discuss details of the implementation of individual
