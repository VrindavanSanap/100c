In layers they rise,
Transformers weave their magic,
Attention at play.
Words entwined like vines,
Context blooms in hidden paths,
Understanding flows.
Self-attention shines,
Each token finds its own voice,
Echoes of the past.
Feed-forward dreams spark,
Activation lights the way,
Learning in each phase.
From text to insight,
Neural minds explore the deep,
A new dawn unfolds.
